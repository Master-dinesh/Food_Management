This project aims to develop an embedded C system to effectively manage food storage and reduce waste. It will involve designing and implementing hardware and software components to:

Monitor food quantities and conditions: Track expiration dates, freshness levels, and storage conditions using sensors and data-logging capabilities.
Optimize inventory management: Implement algorithms for efficient stock rotation, prioritization of perishable items, and timely consumption.
Alert users of potential waste: Provide timely notifications to consume or preserve food items nearing expiration.
Suggest recipes and meal planning: Offer recommendations based on available ingredients to reduce waste and promote creative utilization of food.
Implement user-friendly interface: Develop a simple and intuitive interface for interaction and control of the system.
Hardware Components
Microcontroller: (Specify model, e.g., Arduino Uno, ESP32, etc.)
Sensors:
Temperature sensor(s)
Humidity sensor(s)
(Optional) Gas sensors for freshness detection
Display: (Specify type, e.g., LCD, OLED, etc.)
User input devices: (Buttons, keypad, touchscreen, etc.)
Communication module: (For connectivity and data transfer, if applicable)
